This Python program measures and analyzes reverberation time (RT60) in enclosed spaces. The accompanying graphical user interface (GUI) streamlines importing, cleaning, visualizing, analyzing, and modeling data related to reverberation times. The project utilizes Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Numpy for Scientific Calculations. To run the program, run the view.py program to display the GUI and use its functionalities. 

Requirements:
Run "py -m pip install" on all of the modules as they are required:
  - ffmpeg
  - pydub
  - pytaglib
